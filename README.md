üî• YOLOv8 Fire and Smoke Detection with Flask Integration

This repository showcases an advanced real-time video streaming web application that uses YOLOv8 for detecting fire and smoke in live video feeds. The solution is built with Flask, enabling fast, responsive detection and visual feedback for safety monitoring purposes.


üöÄ Project Overview
In this project, we integrate YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model, with Flask to create a web interface that supports video uploads and real-time fire and smoke detection. The application processes video frames, detects fire and smoke with high accuracy, and highlights these regions using bounding boxes.


Key Features:
Real-time video streaming: The application continuously processes video frames and updates detection results live.
YOLOv8 model integration: Detects fire and smoke with precise bounding boxes and confidence scores.
Flask-based web interface: Simple and intuitive UI for video uploads and live results display.
Visual highlighting: Detected fire and smoke are visually marked on the video using colored bounding boxes.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
YOLOv8: Cutting-edge object detection model.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for serving video streams.
OpenCV: Used for handling video frames and processing images.
NumPy: For efficient array manipulation.
Werkzeug: Secure file handling.
üìÑ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
YOLOv8 (from the ultralytics library)
Flask
OpenCV
NumPy
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code

pip install ultralytics
pip install -U Flask

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov8-fire-smoke-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:


python
Copy code
YOLOV8_MODEL_PATH = 'path_to_your_yolov8_model/best.pt'
Run the Flask app: Start the server by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Upload a video file: Upload your video via the interface and see the real-time fire and smoke detection in action.

üñºÔ∏è How It Works
Video Upload: Users can upload videos directly from the web interface.
Real-time Detection: The YOLOv8 model processes video frames in real-time, detecting instances of fire and smoke.
Visual Feedback: Bounding boxes and labels (e.g., "Fire") are rendered over the detected areas in the video, with confidence scores displayed.
User Interface: A live feed is shown in the browser, updating continuously as the model processes the video frames.
üí° Potential Use Cases
Surveillance systems: Automatically detect fire hazards in real-time in industrial and public spaces.
Safety monitoring: Integrate this solution with existing monitoring systems for fire and smoke detection in high-risk areas.
üöß Challenges and Solutions
Real-time Performance: Managing efficient real-time processing on lower-end systems can be a challenge. Leveraging frame resizing and model optimizations can help in such scenarios.
False Positives: To minimize detection errors, confidence thresholds can be fine-tuned, and multiple video streams analyzed simultaneously to cross-verify results.
üìà Future Enhancements
Integration with live camera feeds: Extend the application to work with live video streams from security cameras.
Alarm systems: Automatically trigger alerts or notifications when fire or smoke is detected.
Mobile-friendly interface: Optimize the app UI for mobile browsers for more flexibility.
